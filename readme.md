Project Structure and Usage Instructions
-----

**Starter Page**

Start coding on the `blank.html` page, this is your primary page for development. The `index.html` page works as a demonstration of how to use Tailwind CSS and is not intended for further development.

**JavaScript and CSS Files**

The main files that you need to modify to add JavaScript functionality and CSS styles are:

- JavaScript: `./assets/src/js/app.js`
- CSS: `./assets/src/css/app.scss`

These are your source files where you can write your custom JavaScript and CSS code.

**Built Files**

Following the build process, your JavaScript and CSS are compiled and output to the following locations:

- JavaScript: `./assets/dist/js/app.randomhash.js`
- CSS: `./assets/dist/css/style.randomhash.scss`

The 'randomhash' in the file names denotes a unique identifier that is generated during the build process.

**Important Note:** You are not advised to modify the files in the `dist` folder directly. This folder contains the built files (the output from the build process) which will be overwritten during each subsequent build. All code modifications should be done in the source files (`./assets/src/js/app.js` and `./assets/src/css/app.scss`).
